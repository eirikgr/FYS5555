# CompHEP

CompHEP is basically a package for the evaluation of cross-sections at tree-level. It is very useful as you can compare its results to those of your calculations. 

There are two ways to install CompHEP:

1. Install it on your PC directly by following the instructions on the page https://theory.sinp.msu.ru/dokuwiki/doku.php/comphep/news

2. Set up a virtual machine that runs CERN CentOS 7 with CompHEP, ROOT, and Python notebooks pre-installed and tested. You will find the detailed instructions here: https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS4505/h18/diverse-resurser/vm-instructions-fys4505.pdf

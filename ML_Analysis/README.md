# Machine learning analysis

Machine learning tools to be used for educational purposes

- In the "small_file_analysis", you will find a simple classification of two SM backgrounds (Zmumu and ttbar). Note that in this example, uproot is used directly but for the general analysis, a different method will be used due to memory constraints.
- A more general (and more complicated) classification analysis is given in the "OsloML" folder. Read the instructions in the respective README file.
- The folder "GeiloWinterSchool2018" is a good place to learn about machine learning and the different algorithms.
- Machine learning analysis on the Higgs data is located in the "Higgs_ML" folder. There you will find all necessary details on the boosted decision tree (BDT).
